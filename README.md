### pbc.py
Reveals the width, height, offset X and offset Y for the .pbc file. Also able to create an image. Partially taken (half stolen) from [Treeki](https://github.com/Treeki/CylindricalEarth/commits?author=Treeki)'s ["pbc.py"](https://github.com/Treeki/CylindricalEarth/blob/master/pbc.py) and ["display_pbc.py."](https://github.com/Treeki/CylindricalEarth/blob/master/display_pbc.py)
## Info
### Hex Codes.md
In .pbc files, hex codes such as 16 are present. pbc.py turns these into images with hex codes that use the 16 and turn it into #161616. These are just hex codes I've gathered through exploring.
