# Info on Hex Codes

In .pbc files, hex codes such as 16 are present. [pbc.py](https://github.com/slyrp/ACNH/blob/main/pbc.py) turns these into images with hex codes that use the 16 and turn it into #161616. These are just hex codes I've gathered through exploring.

(?) = Not sure or just guessing
<br>
(-) = Pretty sure but not 100% confident

Everything else I am confident on.


16 = Walkable and/or walkway
25 = Unwalkable
